# AHelpingHand
A Helping Hand connects users to volunteering within their communities. This app allows users to create posts (much like Facebook or Instagram) with tasks that they need volunteers for, and select interested volunteers to aid them with this task.

This app was migrated to Thunkable for better cross-platform support, and can be found here: https://thunkable.site/w/u6wksms_c
